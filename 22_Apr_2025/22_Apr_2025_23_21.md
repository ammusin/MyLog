### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The Rust application uses the Dioxus framework to create a web-based user interface.

The application includes a CSS file for styling and defines two main components: `App` (for structure and styling) and `Content` (for file reading and rendering).

### Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 26  
- **Number of Functions**: 3 (`main`, `App`, `Content`)  
- **Number of Classes**: 0
