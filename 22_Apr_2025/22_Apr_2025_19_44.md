# Sinchana's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 at 7:44:05 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Overview

The files listed appear to belong to a **Rust-based project** that involves **WebAssembly (WASM)** and **Dioxus**, a modern Rust framework for building user interfaces. The project seems to be a **teleprompter application** that runs in the browser, leveraging WebAssembly for performance and Dioxus for UI rendering. The presence of `.wasm` files, `Cargo.toml`, and `Dioxus.toml` indicates a Rust project targeting web platforms.

This project is likely **building a functional application** rather than being a learning exercise, given the complexity and the number of dependencies.

### Project Purpose

This project is **building a teleprompter application** for use in web browsers. It leverages Rust for performance, Dioxus for UI, and WebAssembly for cross-platform compatibility. The files indicate a production-level application rather than a learning exercise. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The Rust application uses the `dioxus` framework to create a simple UI that dynamically reads and displays the content of a text file located in the user's home directory. It uses a CSS file for styling.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 27
- **Number of Functions**: 3 (`main`, `App`, `Content`)
- **Number of Classes**: 0
- **Number of Static Variables**: 1 (`CSS`)
- **Number of Constants**: 1 (`FILE_PATH`)
