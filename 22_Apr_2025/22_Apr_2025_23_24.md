### File Descriptions

#### 1. **tempCodeRunnerFile.py**
   - **Description**: This is a temporary file automatically generated by Visual Studio Code when you run a specific portion of Python code from the editor. It is not part of the project and is used only for quick testing or debugging.
   - **Purpose**: Temporary file for testing code snippets.
   - **Relevance**: Not directly related to the project.

#### 2. **main.py**
   - **Description**: This is likely the main Python script for the project. It could serve as the entry point for the application, containing the core logic or functionality.
   - **Purpose**: Implements the primary functionality of the project.
   - **Relevance**: Essential to the project.

#### 3. **dataset_recipe2.csv**
   - **Description**: This file appears to be a dataset in CSV format, possibly containing structured data related to recipes. It might be used for data analysis, machine learning, or as input for the application.
   - **Purpose**: Provides data for the project.
   - **Relevance**: Supports the functionality of the project.

#### 4. **script.txt**
   - **Description**: This is a plain text file. Based on its name, it might contain notes, instructions, or a script for the project (e.g., a sequence of steps or commands).
   - **Purpose**: Likely used for documentation or as a reference for the project.
   - **Relevance**: May provide supplementary information for the project.

#### 5. **main.css**
   - **Description**: This is a CSS file, likely used for styling the front-end of the project if it has a web-based interface.
   - **Purpose**: Defines the visual design and layout of the project.
   - **Relevance**: Relevant if the project includes a web component.

### Project Description
- **Type**: The files suggest this is a project that combines Python programming (possibly for data processing or backend logic) with a web-based front-end (styled using `main.css`).
- **Purpose**: The project might involve working with recipe data (`dataset_recipe2.csv`), potentially for a recipe recommendation system, data visualization, or a similar application.
- **Learning or Building**: Based on the file structure, this appears to be a **project-building exercise** rather than purely for learning. However, it could also involve learning new skills like integrating Python with web development or working with datasets. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code is a Flask-based web application that functions as a teleprompter. It reads a script from a file (`script.txt`) and displays its content on a webpage. If the file is unavailable, an error message is shown. The application uses a simple HTML template and runs in debug mode, serving requests at the root URL (`/`).

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 33  
- **Number of Functions:** 1 (`index`)  
- **Number of Classes:** 0  
- **Number of Routes:** 1 (`/`)  
- **External Libraries Used:** Flask, pathlib
