### Project Description
The files listed suggest that the project is built using **Next.js**, a React-based framework for building server-rendered or statically generated web applications. The presence of configuration files like `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, and `package.json` indicates that this is a web development project. The project likely involves creating a dynamic website or web application, possibly with custom layouts, routing, and styling.

It appears to be a **learning project** or **development project**, as it includes files for configuration, testing, and optimization. The `.env.local` file suggests environment-specific variables, which are common in projects requiring API integrations or sensitive data.
