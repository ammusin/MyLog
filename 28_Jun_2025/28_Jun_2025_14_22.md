### Project Description
The files listed suggest that the project is built using **Next.js**, a React-based framework for building web applications. The presence of files like `next.config.mjs`, `page.tsx`, and `layout.ts` indicates that this is a **Next.js project**. The project likely involves creating a web application with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), or client-side rendering (CSR). The inclusion of `.env.local` suggests that environment variables are used, possibly for API keys or configuration settings.

This project appears to be **building a web application**, not just learning new skills, as it includes configuration files, manifests, and build-related files typical of production-ready projects.
