### Project Description
The files listed suggest that the project is a **Next.js web application**. Next.js is a React-based framework for building server-rendered or statically-generated web applications. The presence of configuration files like `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, and `package.json` indicates that this project is focused on web development, likely involving modern JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS styling, and server-side rendering.

This project appears to be **building a web application**, not just learning new skills, as it includes production-ready configurations, manifests, and assets.
