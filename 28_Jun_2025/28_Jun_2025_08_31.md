This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Overview

The files listed suggest that the project is built using **Next.js**, a React-based framework for building web applications. The presence of configuration files like `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, and `package.json` indicates that this is a web development project. The project appears to be focused on creating a website or web application, possibly with dynamic routing and global styling. The inclusion of `.gitignore` suggests version control is being used, likely with Git.

Based on the file names, this project is likely **building a web application** rather than being solely for learning purposes. However, it could also serve as a learning experience for mastering Next.js, React, and web development best practices.
