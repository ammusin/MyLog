### Purpose of the Project
This project appears to be **building a cross-platform application** using Flutter. The presence of platform-specific files for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Web suggests that the project is intended to run on multiple platforms. It could be a learning project or a production-ready app, depending on its complexity. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
This Flutter code implements a basic counter app. It uses `MaterialApp` for app structure and theming. The main screen, `MyHomePage`, displays a counter and a button. The counter increments dynamically using Flutter's `setState` when the button is pressed.

### Code Statistics:
- **File Name:** Not provided
- **Lines of Code:** 91
- **Number of Classes:** 3 (`MyApp`, `MyHomePage`, `_MyHomePageState`)
- **Number of Functions:** 3 (`main`, `_incrementCounter`, `build` in `_MyHomePageState`)
- **Stateful Widgets:** 1 (`MyHomePage`)
- **Stateless Widgets:** 1 (`MyApp`)
