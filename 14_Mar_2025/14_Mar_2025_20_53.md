### File: app.js

**Description:**
`app.js` is typically the main entry point for a Node.js application. It is responsible for setting up the server, configuring middleware, defining routes, and handling requests and responses.

**Project Type:**
This file is likely part of a web application project, possibly using frameworks like Express.js for building server-side applications.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of `app.js` is to initialize and configure the server, connect to databases, and set up the necessary routes and middleware for the application to function.

**Learning or Building:**
This file is generally created as part of building a project rather than just learning a new skill, as it involves setting up a functional server and handling real-world application logic.

**Example Content:**
```javascript
// JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This example sets up a basic Express server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello World!" when the root URL is accessed.
