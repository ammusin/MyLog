- **Relevance**: It is part of the project but not directly edited by the developer.

#### 2. **tempCodeRunnerFile.py**
- **Description**: This is a temporary file generated by Visual Studio Code when running a specific portion of code from the active document. It is used to execute selected code snippets.
- **Purpose**: It is not part of the project but a temporary file created by the IDE for testing purposes.
- **Relevance**: Not directly relevant to the project.

#### 3. **chatbot.py**
- **Description**: This is the main Python script for the project. Based on the name, it likely contains the implementation of a chatbot, which could include natural language processing (NLP), user interaction logic, and response generation.
