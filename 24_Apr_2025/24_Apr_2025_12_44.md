### File: `main.py`

#### Description:
The `main.py` file is typically the entry point of a Python application. It often contains the primary logic to initialize and run the program. This file may include function calls, class instantiations, or the main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to start the application.

#### Project Context:
The project this file belongs to is likely a Python-based application. The specific purpose of the project depends on the other files and context, but `main.py` is generally used to tie together the functionality of the application.

#### Project Purpose:
- **Learning New Skills**: If the project is small and exploratory, `main.py` might be used to practice Python programming, experiment with libraries, or learn new concepts.
- **Building a Project**: If the project is structured with multiple modules or files, `main.py` is likely part of a larger application being developed for a specific purpose, such as a web app, data processing tool, or automation script. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code is a General Knowledge Flashcard application built with the `tkinter` library for the GUI. It displays questions from a predefined list, accepts user input for answers, provides feedback, updates the score for correct answers, and cycles through flashcards in random order.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 63  
- **Number of Classes**: 1 (`GKCardApp`)  
- **Number of Functions**: 3 (`__init__`, `show_question`, `check_answer`, `next_card`)  
- **Number of Flashcards**: 4  
- **Libraries Used**: 2 (`tkinter`, `random`)
