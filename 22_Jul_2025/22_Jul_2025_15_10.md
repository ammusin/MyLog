   - **Learning or Building**: If this file is part of a structured project, it is likely being used to build something. However, if it is standalone or part of a tutorial, it may be for learning purposes.

#### 2. **lecture6.html**
   - **Purpose**: This file appears to be an HTML document, possibly containing content or notes for a lecture (e.g., Lecture 6). It might include text, images, or links relevant to the lecture topic.
   - **Project**: Likely part of a learning project or course material, such as a web development or educational project.
   - **Learning or Building**: This file is likely created for learning purposes, as it seems to be part of a lecture series.

#### 3. **lecture5.html**
   - **Purpose**: Similar to `lecture6.html`, this file is another HTML document, likely containing content or notes for Lecture 5.
   - **Project**: Part of the same learning project or course material as `lecture6.html`.
   - **Learning or Building**: This file is also likely created for learning purposes.

#### 4. **Desktop - Shortcut.lnk**
   - **Purpose**: This is a Windows shortcut file, unrelated to the project.
   - **Project**: Not relevant to the project.
   - **Learning or Building**: Not applicable.

### Summary
The files `lecture6.html` and `lecture5.html` suggest the user is working on a learning project, possibly related to web development or an educational course. The `main.py` file could either be part of a learning exercise or a standalone project, depending on its context. The `.lnk` file is unrelated to the project. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code implements a function `findPathInGrid` to determine the longest strictly increasing path in a grid, restricted to right or down movements. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization for efficiency.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 27  
- **Number of Functions**: 2 (`findPathInGrid`, `dfs`)  
- **Number of Classes**: 0  
- **Number of Variables**: 6  
- **Key Features**: Recursive DFS, memoization, grid traversal.
