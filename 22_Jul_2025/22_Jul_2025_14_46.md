### File Descriptions

#### 1. **main.py**
   - **Purpose**: This is typically the entry point of a Python project. It likely contains the main logic or script that executes the program. Depending on the project, it could include functions, classes, or scripts to perform specific tasks.
   - **Project Context**: This file suggests the project is written in Python. It could be a standalone script, part of a larger application, or a learning exercise.
   - **Learning or Building**: If this is part of a course or tutorial, it may be used to learn Python programming or a specific skill. If it's part of a larger project, it could be building a functional application.

#### 2. **lecture6.html**
   - **Purpose**: This is an HTML file, likely containing content related to "Lecture 6." It might include lecture notes, slides, or a webpage for educational purposes.
   - **Project Context**: This file suggests the project is related to web development or an educational course. It could be part of a series of lectures or tutorials.
   - **Learning or Building**: This file is likely created as part of a learning process, such as studying web development or following an online course.

#### 3. **lecture5.html**
   - **Purpose**: Similar to `lecture6.html`, this file likely contains content for "Lecture 5." It may include notes, slides, or a webpage for educational purposes.
   - **Project Context**: This file is also part of the same educational or web development project as `lecture6.html`.
   - **Learning or Building**: This file is likely created for learning purposes, such as studying web development or following an online course.

#### 4. **Desktop - Shortcut.lnk**
   - **Purpose**: This is a Windows shortcut file, unrelated to the project. It is not relevant to the coding context.
   - **Project Context**: Not applicable.
   - **Learning or Building**: Not applicable.

### Project Overview
The files `main.py`, `lecture6.html`, and `lecture5.html` suggest that the project is either:
1. A **learning project** where the user is studying Python programming and web development concepts, possibly as part of a course or tutorial.
2. A **hybrid project** combining Python and web development, such as creating a web-based application or tool.

The presence of lecture-related HTML files strongly indicates an educational focus, likely aimed at learning new skills. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code implements a function `findPathInGrid` to determine the longest path in a grid where each step moves to a cell with a strictly greater value, restricted to right or down directions. It uses DFS with memoization to optimize calculations. If no valid path exists, it returns `-1`.

### Code Statistics:
- **File Name:** Not provided
- **Lines of Code:** 25
- **Number of Functions:** 2 (`findPathInGrid`, `dfs`)
- **Number of Classes:** 0
- **Number of Loops:** 2
- **Number of Conditional Statements:** 3
