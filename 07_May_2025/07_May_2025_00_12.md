### File Descriptions

#### `test.webp`
- **Description**: This is likely an image file in the WebP format. It may be used for testing purposes, such as evaluating a machine learning model's performance or demonstrating the output of an image processing pipeline.
- **Purpose**: Likely serves as input data for testing the functionality of the project, such as an image classification or object detection task.

#### `main.py`
- **Description**: This is the main Python script for the project. It likely contains the core logic for running the application, such as loading a pre-trained model, processing input data, and generating predictions or outputs.
- **Purpose**: Acts as the entry point for the project, orchestrating the workflow and integrating various components.

#### `efficientnetb0_finetuned.h5`
- **Description**: This is a pre-trained and fine-tuned model file in the HDF5 format. It likely contains the weights and architecture of an EfficientNet-B0 model that has been fine-tuned on a specific dataset for a particular task, such as image classification.
- **Purpose**: Used by the project to make predictions or perform inference without needing to retrain the model.

### Project Description
- **Project Type**: This appears to be a machine learning project focused on image classification or a similar task. The use of a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model suggests that the project involves leveraging transfer learning to achieve high accuracy on a specific dataset.
- **Purpose**: The project is likely aimed at building a functional application, such as an image recognition system, rather than solely for learning purposes. However, it may also serve as a learning exercise if the user is exploring transfer learning or model fine-tuning.
