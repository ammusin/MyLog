This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### File Descriptions

#### `main.py`
- **Description**: This is likely the main script of the project. It typically contains the core logic, such as loading data, preprocessing, training, or testing a machine learning model. In this case, it might involve loading a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model and fine-tuning it for a specific task.
- **Purpose**: Acts as the entry point for the project, orchestrating the workflow.
- **Relevance**: This file is central to the project as it likely contains the implementation of the machine learning pipeline.

#### `efficientnetb0_finetuned.h5`
- **Description**: This is a saved model file in the HDF5 format. It likely contains the weights of an EfficientNetB0 model that has been fine-tuned on a specific dataset for a particular task.
- **Purpose**: Used to load the pre-trained and fine-tuned model for inference or further training.
- **Relevance**: Essential for the project as it represents the trained model that the project is built around.

### Project Description
- **Project Type**: Machine Learning/Deep Learning Project
- **Purpose**: The project appears to involve fine-tuning the EfficientNetB0 model, which is a convolutional neural network architecture, for a specific task such as image classification, object detection, or another computer vision task.
- **Learning or Building**: This project is likely focused on **building** a functional application using a pre-trained model. However, it could also involve **learning** if the goal is to understand the process of fine-tuning and deploying machine learning models.

### Notes
- The file `test.webp` is not directly relevant to the project description as it is likely an image file used for testing the model. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The Python script uses TensorFlow and Keras to load a pre-trained model (`efficientnetb0_finetuned.h5`) with custom objects (`swish` activation and `FixedDropout`) and makes predictions on a preprocessed input image (`test.webp`). The predicted class index is printed, with an option to display the class name if a mapping is available.

### Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 22
- **Number of Functions**: 0
- **Number of Classes**: 1 (`FixedDropout`)
- **Number of Imports**: 4
- **Key Operations**: Model loading, image preprocessing, prediction, result display
