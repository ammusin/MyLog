### Project Overview
Based on the provided file names, this project appears to be a **TypeScript-based web application** built using **Vite** as the build tool. It also incorporates **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Supabase** for backend services. The presence of files like `Dashboard.tsx`, `AuthForm.tsx`, and `Leaderboard.tsx` suggests that this is a **dashboard or web application** with authentication, user interaction, and possibly gamification or challenge-based features. The project seems to be a **real-world application** rather than a learning exercise, as it includes structured configurations and backend integrations.
