### Project Overview
The files listed suggest a **TypeScript-based web application** built with **Vite** as the build tool. The project also incorporates **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Supabase** for backend services, and possibly **React** (based on the presence of `.tsx` files). The project appears to be a **learning project** or a **prototype** for building a web application with modern tools and frameworks.
