### Project Overview
Based on the provided file names, this appears to be a **TypeScript-based web application** built using **React** and **Vite** as the build tool. The project also integrates **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Supabase** for backend services (e.g., authentication, database). The presence of files like `Tasks.tsx`, `Leaderboard.tsx`, and `Challenges.tsx` suggests that this project might be a **task management or gamified productivity application**. The files indicate that this is a **project-building exercise**, not just for learning individual skills, as it involves multiple technologies and structured components.
