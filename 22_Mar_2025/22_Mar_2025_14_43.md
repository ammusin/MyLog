### Project Overview
Based on the provided file names, this appears to be a **TypeScript-based web application** that uses **Vite** as the build tool and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The project also integrates **Supabase** (a backend-as-a-service platform) and possibly includes features like authentication, a dashboard, and challenges. The presence of `.tsx` files suggests that the project uses **React** as the front-end framework.

This project is likely **building a functional application** rather than being a learning exercise, as it includes structured files for configuration, styling, and backend integration.
