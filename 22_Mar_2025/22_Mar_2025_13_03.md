### Project Overview
Based on the provided file names, this project appears to be a **TypeScript-based web application** using **Vite** as the build tool. It also incorporates **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Supabase** for backend services. The presence of React components (`.tsx` files) suggests that the project is a **React-based frontend application**. The project seems to involve features like authentication (`AuthForm.tsx`), a dashboard (`Dashboard.tsx`), and challenges (`Challenges.tsx`), indicating it might be a **gamified learning platform or productivity tool**.

The files suggest that this project is **building a functional application**, not just for learning purposes.
