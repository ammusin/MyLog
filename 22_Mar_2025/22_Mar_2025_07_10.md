### Project Overview

The files listed belong to a **Flutter project** that integrates Firebase services such as Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Core. The project appears to be a cross-platform application targeting multiple platforms, including Windows, Android, iOS, and web. The presence of test files and configuration files suggests that the project is both a learning exercise and a functional application under development.

### Purpose of the Project

The project serves a dual purpose:
1. **Learning**: The presence of test files, Firebase integration, and platform-specific configurations suggests the developer is learning Flutter and Firebase.
2. **Building a Functional App**: The structured organization and inclusion of production-ready assets indicate the project is also aimed at creating a deployable application. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
This Flutter application integrates Firebase for user authentication. It includes three screens: `SignupScreen` for account creation, `LoginScreen` for user login, and `HomeScreen` for displaying a welcome message post-login. Firebase is initialized in the `main` function, and `MaterialApp` is used for navigation. The app employs `FirebaseAuth` for authentication, `TextEditingController` for input handling, and includes error handling and loading indicators for improved user experience.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 143  
- **Number of Classes**: 6  
- **Number of Functions**: 6  
- **Number of Screens**: 3 (`SignupScreen`, `LoginScreen`, `HomeScreen`)  
- **External Packages Used**: 3 (`firebase_auth`, `firebase_core`, `flutter/material.dart`)
