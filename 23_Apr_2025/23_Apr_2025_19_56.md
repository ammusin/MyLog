### Project Description
- **Type of Project**: Based on the file names, this project appears to be a **web application** or a **Python-based project with a front-end component**. The presence of `main.py` suggests backend logic, while `main.css` indicates a styled front-end.
- **Purpose**: The project could be a learning exercise to practice web development and Python programming or a small-scale application being built for practical use.
- **Learning or Building**: 
  - If the project is simple and exploratory, it is likely created to **learn new skills** in Python and web development.
  - If the project is more structured and complex, it is likely **building a functional application**. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
This is a Flask web application that acts as a teleprompter. It reads a script from a file (`script.txt`) in the `Teleprompter_main` directory and displays it on a webpage. If the file is unavailable, an error message is shown. The app uses `render_template_string` to generate the HTML dynamically and runs in debug mode, serving content at the root URL (`/`).

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 37  
- **Number of Functions:** 1 (`index`)  
- **Number of Classes:** 0  
- **Number of Imports:** 3 (`Flask`, `render_template_string`, `Path`, `os`)  
- **Number of Routes:** 1 (`/`)
