   - **Purpose**: This file is automatically generated by Visual Studio Code when you run a selected portion of Python code in the editor. It temporarily stores the code snippet being executed.
   - **Project Relation**: Not directly related to the project. It is a temporary file created by the IDE.
   - **Learning or Building**: This file is incidental and not part of learning or building a project.

#### 2. **script.txt**
   - **Purpose**: A `.txt` file typically contains plain text. Based on the name, it might include notes, pseudocode, or instructions related to the project.
   - **Project Relation**: Could be used for planning or documenting the project.
   - **Learning or Building**: Likely used as a supporting file for building the project.

#### 3. **main.css**
   - **Purpose**: A CSS file used to style the front-end of a web application. It defines the visual appearance of the project, such as layout, colors, and typography.
   - **Project Relation**: Essential for the front-end design of the project.
   - **Learning or Building**: Indicates the project involves web development, suggesting the user is building a project.

#### 4. **main.py**
   - **Purpose**: A Python file that likely serves as the entry point or core logic of the project. It could contain the main functionality or script execution.

### Project Description
- **Project Type**: This appears to be a web development project that combines Python for backend logic and CSS for front-end styling. The presence of `main.py` suggests Python is used for scripting or server-side functionality, while `main.css` indicates a focus on user interface design.
- **Purpose**: The project could be a small web application or a learning exercise to integrate Python and CSS.
- **Learning or Building**: Based on the file names, this project is likely being built to develop a functional application, though it may also serve as a way to learn or practice skills in Python and web development. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The Python script implements a teleprompter application that scrolls text from a file (`script.txt`) on an SSD1309 OLED display. It uses the `luma.oled` library for display control and `Pillow` for text rendering, with scrolling achieved by adjusting the vertical offset in a loop.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code**: 38  
- **Number of Functions**: 1 (`scroll_teleprompter`)  
- **Number of Classes**: 0  
- **Number of Imports**: 6  
- **External Libraries Used**: `luma.core`, `luma.oled`, `Pillow`, `pathlib`, `time`
