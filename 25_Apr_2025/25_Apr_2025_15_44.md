### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
The code implements a teleprompter application using the `tkinter` library. It reads a script from a file, displays it in a fullscreen window with scrolling text, and allows the user to exit by pressing the "Escape" key. Error handling ensures robustness if the file cannot be loaded.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 37  
- **Number of Functions:** 1 (`scroll`)  
- **Number of Classes:** 0  
- **Number of Imports:** 2 (`tkinter`, `pathlib`)  
- **Number of Event Bindings:** 1 (`<Escape>` key)
