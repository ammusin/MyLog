### Purpose of the Project
This project is **building a cross-platform application** with Flutter. It integrates Firebase for backend services and includes features like authentication, leaderboards, and eco challenges. The presence of platform-specific files and configurations indicates that the project is intended for production use rather than learning purposes. 
### Project Description:
 ### Code Summary:
This Flutter code implements a basic counter app. It uses `MaterialApp` for app structure and a `StatefulWidget` to manage the counter state. The counter value is displayed at the center of the screen and increments when the floating action button is pressed, with `setState` ensuring the UI updates.

### Code Statistics:
- **Lines of Code:** 33  
- **Number of Classes:** 3 (`MyApp`, `CounterScreen`, `_CounterScreenState`)  
- **Number of Functions:** 3 (`main`, `_incrementCounter`, `build`)  
- **Widgets Used:** 8 (`MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Text`, `Center`, `FloatingActionButton`, `Icon`, `TextStyle`)  
- **State Management:** `StatefulWidget` with `setState`
