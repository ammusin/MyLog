# Sinchana's Workspace File Summary
## Generated On: Sunday, June 15, 2025 at 8:43:30 PM
This summary lists all files in the workspace with brief descriptions.
---
### Project Description
The files listed appear to belong to a **machine learning project focused on gesture recognition or keypoint classification**. The project likely involves training and deploying models to classify hand gestures or keypoints using TensorFlow or similar frameworks. It includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, and model files for inference.

The project seems to be aimed at **building a functional application**, rather than solely learning new skills, as it includes trained models (`.tflite`, `.hdf5`) and an application script (`app.py`).

### File Descriptions

#### Common Files
- **README.md**:  
  A documentation file that provides an overview of the project, its purpose, setup instructions, and usage details. It is essential for understanding the project and sharing it with others.

- **LICENSE**:  
  Specifies the legal terms under which the project can be used, modified, and distributed.

- **.gitignore**:  
  A configuration file that lists files and directories to be ignored by Git version control, such as temporary files, compiled binaries, or model weights.

---

#### Python Scripts
- **`__init__.py`**:  
  Marks the directory as a Python package. It may contain initialization code for the package.

- **cvfpscalc.py**:  
  Likely a utility script for calculating frames per second (FPS) for computer vision tasks, useful for performance monitoring.

- **point_history_classifier.py**:  
  Contains code for a machine learning model that classifies point history data, possibly related to gesture recognition.

- **keypoint_classifier.py**:  
  Implements a machine learning model for classifying keypoints, such as hand landmarks or body joints.

- **app.py**:  
  The main application script that integrates the models and provides functionality, possibly for real-time gesture recognition.

---

#### Jupyter Notebooks
- **point_history_classification.ipynb**:  
  A notebook for experimenting with and training the point history classifier model.

- **keypoint_classification.ipynb**:  
  A notebook for training and testing the keypoint classifier model.

- **keypoint_classification_EN.ipynb**:  
  Likely a translated or alternate version of `keypoint_classification.ipynb`, possibly in English.

---

#### Model Files
- **point_history_classifier.tflite**:  
  A TensorFlow Lite model for efficient inference of point history classification.

- **point_history_classifier.hdf5**:  
  A model file in HDF5 format, likely used during training or for compatibility with certain frameworks.

- **keypoint_classifier.tflite**:  
  A TensorFlow Lite model for efficient inference of keypoint classification.

- **keypoint_classifier.hdf5**:  
  A model file in HDF5 format for keypoint classification.

- **keypoint_classifier.weights.h5**:  
  Contains trained weights for the keypoint classifier model.

---

#### Data Files
- **point_history_classifier_label.csv**:  
  Contains labels for the point history classifier, mapping numeric values to gesture names.

- **keypoint_classifier_label.csv**:  
  Contains labels for the keypoint classifier, mapping numeric values to gesture names.

- **point_history.csv**:  
  Likely stores point history data used for training or testing the classifier.

- **keypoint.csv**:  
  Likely stores keypoint data used for training or testing the classifier.
