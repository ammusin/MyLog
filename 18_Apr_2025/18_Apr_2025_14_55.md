#### **4. Dioxus.toml**
- **Description**: A configuration file specific to the Dioxus framework.
- **Purpose**: Configures settings for the Dioxus framework, such as build options or runtime behavior.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based project.
- **Learning or Building**: Supports building the project.

#### **5. Cargo.toml**
- **Description**: The manifest file for a Rust project.
- **Purpose**: Specifies project metadata, dependencies, and build configurations.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based project.
- **Learning or Building**: Essential for building the project.

#### **6. Cargo.lock**
- **Description**: A lock file that ensures reproducible builds by locking dependency versions.
- **Purpose**: Tracks exact versions of dependencies used in the project.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based project.
- **Learning or Building**: Supports building the project.

#### **7. main.css**
- **Description**: A CSS file for styling the user interface.
- **Purpose**: Defines the visual appearance of the application.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based project.
- **Learning or Building**: Supports building the project.

#### **8. .gitignore**
- **Description**: A file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- **Purpose**: Prevents unnecessary files (e.g., build artifacts) from being tracked in version control.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based project.
- **Learning or Building**: Supports building the project.

---

### **Project Overview**
- **Project Type**: A Rust-based application using the **Dioxus** framework.
