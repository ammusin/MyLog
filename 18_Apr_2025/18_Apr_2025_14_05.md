---

### **Relevant Files**

#### **README.md**
- **Purpose**: This file typically provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, setup instructions, usage, and other relevant details.
- **Project**: Likely part of a Rust-based project using the Dioxus framework (based on the presence of `Dioxus.toml` and related files).
- **Description**: This file is essential for documenting the project and is not directly related to learning a new skill but rather to building and maintaining the project.

#### **Dioxus.toml**
- **Purpose**: Configuration file specific to the Dioxus framework, which is used for building user interfaces in Rust.
- **Project**: Indicates that the project is a Dioxus-based web application.
- **Description**: This file is part of the project setup and configuration, not for learning but for building the application.

#### **Cargo.toml**
- **Purpose**: The manifest file for Rust projects, specifying dependencies, metadata, and build configurations.
- **Project**: Core to the Rust project, managing dependencies and build settings.
- **Description**: This file is critical for building the project and is not related to learning a new skill.

#### **Cargo.lock**
- **Purpose**: Locks the exact versions of dependencies used in the project to ensure reproducible builds.
- **Project**: Part of the Rust project.
- **Description**: This file is automatically generated and maintained as part of the project build process.

#### **main.rs**
- **Purpose**: The main entry point for the Rust application.
- **Project**: Likely the core logic of the Dioxus-based application.
- **Description**: This file is part of the project and is used for building the application, not for learning.

#### **guide_new_app.rs**
- **Purpose**: Likely a Rust source file providing guidance or examples for creating a new application.
- **Project**: Could be part of the same Dioxus project or a related learning resource.
- **Description**: This file might be used for learning or as a reference for building the project.

#### **index.html**
- **Purpose**: The main HTML file for the web application, likely serving as the entry point for the Dioxus app.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based web application.
- **Description**: This file is part of the project and is used for building the application.

#### **main.css**
- **Purpose**: Stylesheet for the web application, defining the visual appearance of the app.
- **Project**: Part of the Dioxus-based web application.
- **Description**: This file is part of the project and is used for building the application.

---

### **Project Description**
- **Project Type**: A Rust-based web application using the Dioxus framework.
- **Purpose**: Likely a frontend web application, possibly with WebAssembly integration (based on `.wasm` files).
- **Learning or Building**: The project appears to be focused on building a functional application rather than solely for learning purposes.

--- 

### **Summary**
The files listed above are primarily part of a Rust project using the Dioxus framework to build a web application. While some files (e.g., `guide_new_app.rs`) might serve as learning resources, the majority are focused on building and maintaining the project.
